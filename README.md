### Work in progress

This is a clone of kickstarter. (A smarter kickstarter really.)

Users can create Campaigns and set minimum contribution amount. Once the Campaign is successfully funded by contributors, the raised capital will be locked in the smart contract.

In order to use the capital the campaign creator has to create a spending request. A spending request will have a clear purpose, for instance to pay for materials, an amount of ether, and a recipient.

Contributors then vote on that request, and will essentially have a say in how
the capital is being used by the campaign creator. As soon as more than 50% of contributors approve the spending request, the campaign creator can finalize request and the requested value would be sent to the recipient.

Stay tuned...
